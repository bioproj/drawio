    + compares k-mer frequency profiles of metagenomic reads with those of organisms representing a wide range of clades.
+ “In the marker gene approach” ([Ahn et al., 2015, p. 170](zotero://select/library/items/S7FFZNQD)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7ABZHK?page=1&annotation=TMJUCIN3))
    + metagenomic reads are aligned with a set of preselected clade-specific marker genes, and taxonomic classification is inferred from phylogenetic distances to these marker genes.

    + infers the taxonomic composition of a community by searching metagenomic reads against a database of reference genomes
